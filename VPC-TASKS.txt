1. Create 5 VPCs with Different Networks:

#### Using AWS Management Console:
1. Open the VPC console.
2. open to "Your VPCs."
3. Click on "Create VPC" and follow the wizard to create VPCs with different CIDR blocks.

### 2. Create a Customized VPC and Enable DHCP & DNS Options Set:

#### Using AWS Management Console:
1. Open the VPC console.
2. Navigate to "Your VPCs."
3. Click on "Create VPC."
4. Configure the VPC with a custom CIDR block.
5. Choose or create a DHCP options set with custom DNS settings.
6. Complete the wizard and create the VPC.

### 3. Enable Flow Logs for the Newly Created Custom VPC:

#### Using AWS Management Console:
1. Open the VPC console.
2. Navigate to "Your VPCs."
3. Select the custom VPC.
4. Go to the "Flow Logs" tab and click "Create Flow Log."
5. Configure flow log settings, including the destination S3 bucket.
6. Complete the wizard to enable flow logs.

### 4. Create a Network Load Balancer (NLB):

#### Network Load Balancer Flow Diagram:

```
[Internet] ---> [NLB] ---> [Targets (Instances in VPCs)]
```

#### Explanation:
- Internet: Represents incoming traffic from the internet.
- NLB: Network Load Balancer, distributing traffic to backend targets based on IP protocol data.
- Targets (Instances in VPCs):Instances in different VPCs receiving traffic from the NLB.

### 5. Create 3 VPCs & Do Peering Between Them:

#### Using AWS Management Console:
1. Open the VPC console.
2. open to "Your VPCs."
3. Click on "Create VPC" and create three VPCs.
4. Go to "Peering Connections" and create peering connections between VPC pairs.
5. Accept the peering connection requests.

### 6. Access All S3 Buckets in a Single Customized VPC Without Internet:

To access S3 buckets in a custom VPC without internet, you can use VPC Endpoints for Amazon S3. Here's how you can achieve it:

#### Using AWS Management Console:
1. Open the VPC console.
2. Navigate to "Your VPCs."
3. Select the custom VPC.
4. Go to "Endpoints" and click "Create Endpoint."
5. Choose "com.amazonaws.REGION.s3" as the service name.
6. Optionally, you can enable "Enable DNS name" for private DNS resolution.
7. Configure security groups and policies as needed.
8. Complete the wizard to create the VPC endpoint.

Now, instances in the custom VPC can access S3 buckets using the endpoint, and you can restrict internet access for increased security.
